JsComponentManufacturing
========================

Example of using functional, dynamic, and object-oriented JavaScript features to create modules.
Inspired by the GOF factory pattern, this code takes the analogy even further.

Instructions:
* Download the html and js file.
* Step through the code in the browser or your favorite IDE.
    *Notice the control flow when creating the factory.
    *Notice the control flow when saying hello on the product.
        *Notice how the call stack informs you of where the pieces of the object were built.
